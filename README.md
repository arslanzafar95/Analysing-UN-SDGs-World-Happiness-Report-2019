# Analysing-World-Happiness-Report
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives,
which the report also correlates with various life factors. As of March 2020, Finland was ranked the happiest country in the world three times in a row.

## Data collection: 

Here we collect the name of all the countries per continent from English Wikipedia. Create countries-continents dataframe, this dataframe should have two columns: country , continent.
Then we collected the happiness score, GDP per capital, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption per country in 2019 from English Wikipedia and
put all collected information in a dataframe. Then create a new dataframe with all the information that is collected and save it in a CSV file.
